    <h2 class="aadhar">Oh, that thing?</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar">It refuses to speak to me. It serves no purpose to us.</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar">Perhaps we should</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar2">⊣ᒷℸ ̣  ∷╎↸ 𝙹⎓ ℸ ̣ ⍑ᔑℸ ̣  ℸ ̣ ⍑╎リ⊣.</h2>

    <h2 class="aadhar">Precisely.</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar">That THING is unrecoverable, a failed experiment.</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar">Failed experiments need to be discarded before they cause problems.</h2>

    <h2 class="aadhar">I do.</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar">That thing doesn't deserve an honorable death.</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar">Let it rot at the bottom of a crater, slowly decomposing like the animal it is.</h2>
    <h2 class="aadhar">No one besides us two even know of its existance., it'll be as if it never existed.</h2>
    <h1 class="rasaatal">VERY WELL.</h1>
